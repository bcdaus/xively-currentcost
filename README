Requires the following Python libraries:
- pyserial
- xively-python

You should be able to get those using pip.

You need to set ```API_KEY``` and ```FEED_ID``` as environment variables for the script to pick them up. I have done this simply by creating a bash script outside my repo that looks like:

```bash
API_KEY=<your API key here>
FEED_ID=<your feed ID here>

python path/to/cc_xively.py
```

Lastly, you will probably work this out, but it expects there to be two channels/datastreams. These should be named:
- electricity_sensor; and
- temperature sensor
